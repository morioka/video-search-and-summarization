"""SearchRuntime — what a caller hands the library.

Primitives and clients NEVER read env or files; they receive a SearchRuntime
built by whoever already knows the deployment. There is one door,
``from_kwargs``, and callers supply what they have: the CLI passes what
`vss configure` recorded in ~/.vss/config.json, the NAT adapter passes its own
config object.

It previously offered four. ``from_env`` read os.environ, ``from_config_file``
parsed NAT-style YAML with its own interpolation, and ``from_remote`` fetched
/api/v1/runtime/config from a running agent -- roughly 480 lines of parsing,
coercion and interpolation for three ways of answering the same question. Each
also decided *where* configuration lives, which is the caller's business, not
the library's. The remote door was the clearest case: the endpoint it needed is
not exposed, and its own guidance pointed at a `--deployment kubernetes` CLI
flag that no longer exists.

Validation splits by cost. Behaviour knobs are checked eagerly in
``__post_init__`` -- they are cheap and always wrong if wrong. Endpoints are
checked lazily in ``require()``, at the moment a client is built, so a
deployment missing one service still serves the paths that never call it.
