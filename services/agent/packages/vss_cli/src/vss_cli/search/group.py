"""``vss search`` on the fixed verb grammar.

The old surface exposed ``run``, ``embed`` and ``attribute`` as equal
siblings, because it mirrored the three primitive modules in
``search_core.primitives``. That flattened a real hierarchy: SDD §2 keeps
``embed``/``attribute`` as "low-level non-job primitives (developer
surface)", while ``run`` is the job-shaped facade that fuses them. They are
different tiers, and the grammar now says so -- ``run`` sits with
``status``/``get``/``list`` as a framework verb, the primitives are declared
separately and mint no job.

The 50-option surface splits three ways:

* **19 stay** as :class:`SearchRunInput` -- what a caller is asking for.
* **15 leave entirely.** Endpoints, index names and the embedding model are
  read from ``~/.vss/config.json``, which ``vss configure`` populated from
  what the backends reported about themselves.
* **5 are deleted.** ``--deployment/--profile/--namespace/--release/
  --kube-context`` inspected compose files and kubectl; NFR-6 removes
  deployment discovery outright.

Four behaviour knobs (request timeout, frame lookup, result cap, embed-only
fallback) leave the command line without entering the config: they are
caller preferences, not facts about a deployment, so they take library
defaults until a preferences tier exists.
