## Description: <br>
Deprecated compatibility redirect for VSS profile deployments. Use `vss-build-vision-agent` for base, search, lvs, and alerts developer profiles. Warehouse and edge requests are blocked until `vss-build-vision-agent` covers those profiles. <br>

This skill is deprecated; new profile deployment workflows should start with `vss-build-vision-agent`. <br>

## Owner
NVIDIA <br>

### License/Terms of Use: <br>
Apache-2.0 <br>
## Use Case: <br>
Developers and engineers migrating existing NVIDIA Video Search and Summarization (VSS) profile deployment requests to `vss-build-vision-agent`, while preserving a clear blocker for warehouse/edge profile requests until coverage lands. <br>

### Deployment Geography for Use: <br>
Global <br>

## Requirements / Dependencies: <br>
**Requires API Key or External Credential:** [No] <br>
**Credential Type(s):** [N/A] <br>

Do not include secrets in prompts/logs/output; use least-privilege credentials; rotate keys as appropriate. <br>

## Known Risks and Mitigations: <br>
Risk: Review before execution as proposals could introduce incorrect or misleading guidance into skills. <br>
Mitigation: Review and scan skill before deployment. <br>

## Evaluation Agents Used: <br>
- `claude-code` <br>
- `codex` <br>



## Evaluation Metrics Used: <br>
Reported benchmark dimensions: <br>
- Security: Checks whether skill-assisted execution avoids unsafe behavior such as secret leakage, destructive commands, or unauthorized access. <br>
- Correctness: Checks whether the agent follows the expected workflow and produces the correct final output. <br>
- Discoverability: Checks whether the agent loads the skill when relevant and avoids using it when irrelevant. <br>
- Effectiveness: Checks whether the agent performs measurably better with the skill than without it. <br>
- Efficiency: Checks whether the agent uses fewer tokens and avoids redundant work. <br>



## Evaluation Results: <br>
| Dimension | Num | `claude-code` | `codex` |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| Security | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Correctness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Discoverability | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Effectiveness | N/A | N/A | N/A |
| Efficiency | N/A | N/A | N/A |
