# Build Vision Agent

`build-vision-agent` gives agents and developers **agent-ready vision capabilities through a customizable, self-contained application stack** built on the **NVIDIA VSS Blueprint**. A developer or agent adds vision to their application by selecting the capabilities they want (guided intake) or describing them in natural language, and the skill routes to a validated developer profile — or composes the smallest delta overlay on top of one — and deploys it. Use it whenever the user wants vision capabilities composed for them: deploying a stock profile, extending a running deployment, or building a lean custom combination.

**Two ways in:** **guided intake** (state an open intent like "build a vision agent" / "add vision capabilities" and the skill walks you through capability selection) or **prompt-driven** (name the capability or profile directly). Both land on the same routing and composition flow.

## Routing

| Request | Route |
|---|---|
| Deploy, start, run, verify, or stop a named `base`, `alerts`, `lvs`, or `search` profile | Stock mode for that profile. |
| Deploy capabilities that exactly match one current developer profile | Stock mode for the exact match. |
| Build, create, extend, customize, combine, add, or remove capabilities | Delta mode using the closest current developer profile as the Foundation. |
| A named profile qualified as headless | Delta mode off that profile, not a stock deploy. |
| Deploy capabilities with no exact match | Build the smallest delta, then deploy it. |
| Provision, register, or ingest a source (file or live stream) into a deployed build, or fan it out to consumers | `vss-manage-video-io-storage` `references/provision-vios-source.md` — headless, direct REST (resolve consumer ports from `resolved.yml`, confirm no `vss-agent`); not `vss-search-archive`. |
| Resolution leaves a blocker the rules cannot settle (unmapped or ambiguous capability, Foundation tie, singleton conflict, or requested/excluded contradiction) | Clarification gate (`references/composition.md`): after one deterministic pass, ask one structured question, then resolve on the answer. Never re-run the same resolution or guess past the blocker. |
| Deploy, start, run, verify, or stop a warehouse variant (`MODE=2d` or `3d`) | Stock mode, `FOUNDATION=warehouse` (`references/profiles/warehouse.md`). Select the variant per Q2w; expand its `COMPOSE_PROFILES_WH_*` list unchanged. |
| Build, extend, customize, or remove capabilities from a warehouse deployment | Delta mode off the closest `COMPOSE_PROFILES_WH_*` baseline, recorded in `FOUNDATION_VARIANT`. Never prune the VIOS infrastructure peers (`references/services/vios.md`). Changing `MODE`, `BP_PROFILE` or `STREAM_TYPE` selects a different baseline, not a delta. |
| `smartcities` or another industry profile | Stop: `warehouse` is the only supported industry Foundation. |
| Open / generic / "quickstart" intent with no named capability or profile | Guided front door (Q1): Pre-built workflow (Stock mode) or Custom build (Delta mode). |

## Entry Mode (Step 0)

Before routing, detect the **entry mode** — one of three: **Prompt-driven**, **Pre-built workflow**, or **Custom build**. All three share the same downstream machinery (profile catalog, Foundation selection, delta composition, resolution, and deployment); the mode only determines where the flow enters. **Pre-built workflow** is a fast path — it deploys a validated developer profile's authoritative service set unchanged in Stock mode (**no capability delta**), still producing a minimal stock `_builds/<name>/` for the shared validate -> deploy -> readiness -> teardown lifecycle — while **Custom build** is a guided front door onto Delta mode.

### Step 0.0 — Entry-mode detection

Classify the request before any other work:

1. **A concrete capability, microservice, profile, or existing deployment is named** (e.g. "create a profile for streaming dense captioning", "add agentic search to my base deployment", "deploy the alerts profile") → **Prompt-driven**. Parse inputs and continue at Step 1.
2. **An open / generic / first-time / "quickstart" intent with no extractable capability** (e.g. "build a vision agent", "add vision capabilities", "help me get started", "just deploy something"), or no capability description at all → open the **guided front door** (Q1 below), which leads with **Pre-built workflow (the recommended default)** and offers **Custom build**.
3. **Ambiguous** → ask one disambiguating question, or default to the guided front door (it is safe, reversible, and explicit: the user makes selections before anything is generated or deployed). Never silently assume a capability or fall back to a default profile.

### Guided front door — Q1

Ask via `AskUserQuestion` (single-select). Generate or deploy **nothing** until the user selects AND confirms downstream (the deploy prompt for Pre-built workflow; the Step 6 architecture diagram for Custom build).

**Q1 — Starting point.** *"How would you like to start?"*

- **Deploy a pre-built developer workflow** *(recommended for a first run / quickstart)* — Choose from a ready-made, validated VSS developer profile. Fastest path to a running system; no composition needed. Deploys as-is; you can customize it afterward. → **Q2a**
- **Deploy a pre-built industry blueprint** — Warehouse multi-camera perception (2D RT-DETR or 3D Sparse4D) with behavior analytics. Deployed as-is. → **Q2w**
- **Build a custom configuration** — pick the specific vision capabilities you need and let the skill compose the smallest delta overlay for them. → **Q2b**

### Mode: Pre-built workflow (quickstart)

The recommended first-run path. Deploys a validated developer profile via **Stock mode** — it keeps the profile's authoritative `COMPOSE_PROFILES` unchanged (**no delta**: no added or removed profile keys, no new service composes), then writes and deploys the standard stock `_builds/<name>/` artifacts like any other build (Steps 5-9). Ask **Q2a (single-select): "Which pre-built workflow do you want to deploy?"** and map the choice to the developer profile:

| Option | Capability | Profile |
|---|---|---|
| **Base** | VLM dense captioning and Q&A | `base` |
| **Alerts** | VLM real-time alerting or alert verification | `alerts` (mode picked in Q2a-mode) |
| **Video Summarization** | Time-windowed video summaries | `lvs` |
| **Search** | Object and video embeddings + agentic search | `search` |

> **Four-option limit.** `AskUserQuestion` shows at most **four** options per question (single- or multi-select), so Q2a must stay at the four developer profiles above. The `alerts` profile's two modes are **not** separate top-level rows (that would be a fifth option and get silently dropped); they are chosen in a follow-up, **Q2a-mode**, below. More generally, **any** question that needs more than four choices must **not** use the `AskUserQuestion` widget — present the options inline in the conversation and collect a typed reply instead (see **Q2b**, which does this for the capability multi-select).

**Q2a-mode — only when the user picks Alerts (single-select): "Which alerts mode?"** The `alerts` developer profile ships two modes, selected by its `MODE` knob; each has its own checked-in `COMPOSE_PROFILES` set in `dev-profile-alerts/overrides.env`, so both are still stock deployments (no delta):

| Option | Capability | Mode |
|---|---|---|
| **Real-time alerting** | Continuous RT-VLM inspection + real-time alert APIs | `2d_vlm` |
| **Alert verification** | Object detection with analytics and VLM event contextualization (RT-CV detection + behavior analytics + VLM verification + incidents) | `2d_cv` |

These are **predefined developer profiles** — the skill keeps the profile's authoritative `COMPOSE_PROFILES` unchanged (Stock mode, Step 5 exact match) and follows the shared build lifecycle (Steps 5–9). For Alerts, set the profile `MODE` per Q2a-mode.

**Customize a pre-built workflow → Custom build.** After a pre-built deploy (or instead of deploying), offer: *"Want to customize this workflow? I'll use **<selected profile>** as the starting point."* On **yes**, transition into **Custom build**, seeding the selected profile as the **Foundation** and computing a **capability delta** on top of it (the profile itself is never modified — it is only the baseline). The stock build becomes a **Delta build**: the same `_builds/<name>/` machinery now carries the added/removed profile keys and any changed knobs.

### Mode: Pre-built industry blueprint (warehouse)

Reached from Q1 → industry blueprint, or when the request names warehouse
directly. Expand the selected variant's service list unchanged; a delta is
reached by customizing after this deploy, not from Q2w. Read
[`references/profiles/warehouse.md`](references/profiles/warehouse.md) before
asking, and apply its Hard constraints while asking, not after.

Three single-select questions, each inside the four-option cap:

| Question | Options |
|---|---|
| **Q2w-mode** — *"Which warehouse perception mode?"* | `2d` (RT-DETR) · `3d` (Sparse4D, depth-aware) |
| **Q2w-profile** — *"Which deployment variant?"* | `bp_wh` (agent + UI + RTVI VLM) · `bp_wh_kafka` · `bp_wh_redis` |
| **Q2w-size** — *"Minimal or extended?"* | Extended (ELK, analytics API, ingress, monitoring) · Minimal (perception + analytics only) |

Filter the remaining options rather than validating the answers afterwards:

- **Omit `bp_wh` from Q2w-profile when Q2w-mode is `3d`** — the combination is
  unsupported. Leaving it selectable turns an impossible deployment into a late
  runtime failure.
- **Skip Q2w-size entirely for `bp_wh`** — it has no minimal/extended pair.
- Set `SAMPLE_VIDEO_DATASET` and `NUM_STREAMS` from the chosen variant, not from
  the Foundation default.

The three answers select exactly one `COMPOSE_PROFILES_WH_*` list. Record its
name in `FOUNDATION_VARIANT`, expand it verbatim into `COMPOSE_PROFILES`, and
continue at Step 5 with `FOUNDATION=warehouse`.

### Mode: Custom build (guided)

For a user who wants a specific composition. Reached from Q1 → Custom build, or by customizing a pre-built workflow (seeded with that profile as the Foundation). Ask **Q2b (multi-select): "Which vision capabilities do you want? (select all that apply)"** Each option maps to canonical service-profile keys owned by a capability owner under `references/services/`. **Video I/O + storage (VIOS) is always included** — every profile needs it — along with the shared `redis` cache peer that ships with the Foundation; present these as informational, not as choices. The **ELK + Kafka message bus / indexing stack is _not_ unconditional**: it is added only when a selected capability is Kafka-backed or Elasticsearch-indexed (see the note under the table), so a dense-captioning-only build keeps the smallest delta. (When seeded from a pre-built workflow, that profile's capabilities are pre-checked.)

Offer the user **exactly** the capabilities in the table below. Each row's owner contract, canonical service-profile key(s), and closest Foundation profile are fixed — do not invent options or keys outside it. Because this list can exceed four rows and `AskUserQuestion` caps a question at four options, **do not pose Q2b through the `AskUserQuestion` widget** — present this table in the conversation and have the user reply with the capabilities they want (by name or number; multiple allowed). Fall back to an `AskUserQuestion` multi-select only when four or fewer capabilities remain offerable.

| Option (shown to user) | Owner contract (`references/services/`) | Canonical service-profile key(s) | Closest Foundation | Peer notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Dense captioning** — natural-language descriptions of video | `rt-vlm.md` | `rtvi-vlm` | `base` | — |
| **Object detection & tracking (2D)** — bounding boxes, class labels, track IDs | `rt-cv.md` | `perception-2d-fusion` *(search)* / `perception-alerts` *(alerts)* | `search` | Kafka-backed; use the selected profile's key, not the shared `perception` extends source |
| **Semantic search over video** — embeddings + agentic search | `search.md` (+ `rt-embed.md`) | `vss-search-analytics-2d-fusion`, `rtvi-embed` | `search` | Requires RT-CV + RT-Embed + ELK; critique needs RT-VLM unless disabled |
| **Real-time alerting / verification** — VLM-verified incidents | `alerts.md` | `alert-bridge`, `vss-va-mcp`, `vss-video-analytics-api-alerts` | `alerts` | Real-time needs RT-VLM; CV-verification needs RT-CV + Behavior Analytics |
| **Video summarization** — time-windowed summaries on demand | `lvs.md` | `lvs-server` | `lvs` | Requires Agent + one reachable LLM + one VLM/RT-VLM |

**Always included — do not offer as choices:** VIOS video I/O + storage (`vios.md`), the HAProxy ingress (`ingress.md`) — providing a stable, unified interface to the VSS stack so agents and skills reference a single endpoint rather than per-service ports — plus the shared `redis` cache peer that ships with the Foundation. **Added conditionally, never offered directly:** the **ELK + Kafka broker / indexing stack** (`elk.md`) is pulled in **only** for capabilities that are Kafka-backed or Elasticsearch-indexed — Semantic search (`vss-search-analytics-2d-fusion` + `rtvi-embed`), Real-time alerting / verification (`alert-bridge` requires Kafka + Elasticsearch), or Video summarization when its Kafka/ES event or DB backend is enabled; RT-VLM adds Kafka **only** when `RTVI_VLM_KAFKA_ENABLED=true`. A dense-captioning-only build on `base` therefore adds **no** ELK/Kafka, preserving the smallest-delta contract. The LLM NIM (`llm-nim.md`) and VLM NIM (`vlm-nim.md`) model backends are likewise activated only when a selected capability needs a local model (integrated RT-VLM is the `rt-vlm.md` owner, not the VLM NIM backend).

Rules for the multi-select:
- **Offer exactly the table rows** whose owner contract exists under `references/services/` (all rows are present on this branch); show any pending capability disabled with a short "not yet available" note. **Never offer a foundational or model-backend owner as a choice** — do **not** silently offer a capability the skill cannot resolve.
- **Require at least one capability** — the foundational services alone are not a vision agent.
- Multiple selections compose in one deployment (e.g. captioning + alerting, or captioning + detection).

After Q2b, the selected capabilities **are** the required-capability set. Select the closest current developer profile as the **Foundation**, compute the **smallest delta** (add or remove only canonical service-profile keys, change only requested knobs), and continue at Step 2. This is **Delta mode** (per the Routing table); `_builds/<name>/` is created here.

## Steps

1. Detect the **entry mode** (see [Entry Mode (Step 0)](#entry-mode-step-0) above). Then parse the request and any eval specification into required capabilities, excluded capabilities, configuration knobs, and observable success checks. Custom build supplies the capability set directly via multi-select; Pre-built workflow keeps a named profile's authoritative service set unchanged (Stock mode).
2. Read the matching file under `references/profiles/` and `references/sizing.md`. In delta mode, compare all four current **developer** profiles and select exactly one Foundation; ask only when two are equally plausible. `warehouse` never competes in that comparison — it is selected only by an explicit warehouse request. Read `references/edge.md` for DGX Spark or Thor.
3. Before resolution or deployment, run the applicable checks from `references/prerequisites.md`, `references/credentials.md`, and `references/ngc.md`. Read the environment and Brev references when applicable.
4. Read `references/composition.md` and only the capability-owner files under `references/services/` needed by the request.
5. Determine the effective service set. For an exact stock match, keep its authoritative set unchanged. Otherwise compute the smallest delta from the Foundation’s exact `COMPOSE_PROFILES`: add or remove only canonical service profile keys and change only requested environment knobs. If this single pass leaves a blocker the rules cannot settle (an unmapped or ambiguous capability, a Foundation tie, a singleton conflict, or a requested/excluded contradiction), apply the clarification gate in `references/composition.md`: ask one structured question, then resolve on the answer; never re-run the same resolution or guess past the blocker.
6. Before writing delta artifacts or starting a stock or delta deployment, present a compact architecture diagram in the conversation. Show the Foundation, added and removed capability owners and service keys, principal data flows and topics, external endpoints, and GPU/model placement. Do not save the diagram as a build artifact.
7. For every stock or delta build, write `_builds/<name>/override.env`, `_builds/<name>/compose.yml`, and `_builds/<name>/resolved.yml`. Put the Foundation, the full effective `COMPOSE_PROFILES`, required build-local path/host values, and only environment values that are customized or transitively derived from a customization in `override.env`; do not copy unchanged Foundation defaults such as stock ports or model knobs. Make `compose.yml` include the root `deploy/docker/compose.yml` plus only minimal changed or new service Compose files, if any. Treat `<name>` only as a filesystem label; never add it to `COMPOSE_PROFILES`.
8. Generate `resolved.yml` with `docker compose config` using the ordered env layers in `references/composition.md` (a `warehouse` Foundation resolves its env layers from `deploy/docker/industry-profiles/warehouse-operations/`, must run `scripts/render_warehouse_configurator_env.py` *before* `config` so `bp-configurator-<mode>` does not load the checked-in `overrides.env`, and must also run `scripts/validate_warehouse_env.py`), normalize dangling optional dependencies with `scripts/normalize_resolved_yml.py`, then run the mandatory check/create gate in `references/data-directory.md` on every build, deploy or not — it prepares the external `${VSS_DATA_DIR}` any later bring-up needs (this agent's or a hand-run `docker compose up`) and never touches the repo tree. When the effective `COMPOSE_PROFILES` includes an RT-CV perception key (`perception-alerts`, `perception-2d-fusion`), no host-side or agent detector staging is required: the RT-CV container downloads the detector ONNX at first boot (ds-start phase 0) from its mounted `models-download.json` into the world-writable `${VSS_DATA_DIR}/models` the gate just created. Reject stale placeholders and invalid checked-in bind sources with `scripts/validate_resolved_yml.py`; if validation finds real unresolved `${...}` Compose interpolation, add only the missing concrete values to `override.env` and regenerate before proceeding. Do not count escaped container-shell variables such as `$${HOST_IP}` as unresolved Compose interpolation. Validate the selected keys, services, images, required peers, GPU placement, utilization, and requested success checks against that exact file.
9. If deployment was requested, deploy the exact `_builds/<name>/resolved.yml` validated in the previous step, refresh its registry images even when their tags already exist locally, use `references/readiness.md` with the matching profile checks, and follow `references/deployment.md` for the resolved-Compose lifecycle. When a source must be provisioned into the deployed build (a headless build registers none at bring-up), resolve the consumer ports and confirm the build is headless (no `vss-agent`) from `resolved.yml`, then follow `vss-manage-video-io-storage` `references/provision-vios-source.md`. When a search query round-trip is then requested against the deployed build, run `vss configure --base-url <build-origin>` (the fronting `http://$HOST_IP:$HAPROXY_HOST_PORT`) through the project-local entry point (`uv run --project <repo>/services/agent --no-dev vss …`, per `references/deployment_resolution.md`) — not a bare `vss` — then defer entirely to `vss-search-archive` for decomposition, mode, and the query itself. For a warehouse build, use the readiness checks in `references/profiles/warehouse.md` — container state alone is not sufficient — and for cleanup additionally run `deploy/docker/scripts/cleanup_all_datalog.sh -e _builds/<name>/override.env`, which resolves `VSS_DATA_DIR` from the build's own env file. For stop or cleanup, follow `references/teardown.md`: remove project volumes by default and preserve model caches only when the user explicitly requests it.
