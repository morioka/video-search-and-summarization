# RT-VLM Capability Owner

## Capabilities and service keys

| Capability | Canonical service profile key |
|---|---|
| Streaming and file VLM inference | `rtvi-vlm` |

## Required peers

- Integrated mode needs model credentials/cache access but no standalone VLM
  NIM service.
- OpenAI-compatible mode needs a reachable endpoint and matching `VLM_NAME`.
- Kafka is required only when `RTVI_VLM_KAFKA_ENABLED=true`.
- Redis is required only when `ENABLE_REDIS_ERROR_MESSAGES=true`.
- Do not add `vlm_${VLM_MODE}_${VLM_NAME_SLUG}` for an integrated RT-VLM path.

## Available integrated model variants

These are the Cosmos Reason3 checkpoints RT-VLM can load on the integrated path.
`RTVI_VLM_MODEL_PATH` selects the checkpoint; `VLM_NAME` is the id RT-VLM then
advertises at `GET /v1/models`, derived from the path by dropping the `ngc:`
prefix and replacing `/` and `:` with `_`. Take both values from the same row —
a mismatch makes consumers fail with `400 BadParameters: No such model`.

| Model | `VLM_NAME` | `RTVI_VLM_MODEL_PATH` |
|---|---|---|
| CR3 Nano BF16 | `nim_nvidia_cosmos3-nano-reasoner_bf16-final` | `ngc:nim/nvidia/cosmos3-nano-reasoner:bf16-final` |
| CR3 Nano FP8 | `nim_nvidia_cosmos3-nano-reasoner_modelopt-fp8-final_format_fix` | `ngc:nim/nvidia/cosmos3-nano-reasoner:modelopt-fp8-final_format_fix` |
| CR3 Nano NVFP4 | `nim_nvidia_cosmos3-nano-reasoner_modelopt-nvfp4-full-quantize-final_format_fix` | `ngc:nim/nvidia/cosmos3-nano-reasoner:modelopt-nvfp4-full-quantize-final_format_fix` |
| CR3 Super BF16 | `nim_nvidia_cosmos3-super-reasoner_modelopt-bf16-final` | `ngc:nim/nvidia/cosmos3-super-reasoner:modelopt-bf16-final` |
| CR3 Super FP8 | `nim_nvidia_cosmos3-super-reasoner_modelopt-fp8-final_format_fix` | `ngc:nim/nvidia/cosmos3-super-reasoner:modelopt-fp8-final_format_fix` |
| CR3 Super NVFP4 | `nim_nvidia_cosmos3-super-reasoner_modelopt-nvfp4-full-quantize-final_format_fix` | `ngc:nim/nvidia/cosmos3-super-reasoner:modelopt-nvfp4-full-quantize-final_format_fix` |

Notes on choosing a row:

- **Default to the profile, not to this table.** When the user does not name a
  model or quantization, keep the variant the selected deployment profile already
  ships and leave `RTVI_VLM_MODEL_PATH` / `VLM_NAME` untouched (`alerts` and
  `lvs` ship Nano BF16, `search` ships Nano FP8). Consult this table only when
  the user asks for a specific variant, or when placement forces a change under
  [Singleton and variant convergence](#singleton-and-variant-convergence).
- Nano is the default family for every profile in this repo; select Super only on
  an explicit request.
- Within a family, quantization is a memory/placement decision, not a capability
  one: BF16 is heaviest, FP8 fits alongside another GPU service, NVFP4 is the
  lightest and requires FP4-capable (Blackwell-class) hardware.
- Super is supported only on H100 and RTX PRO 6000, and needs one GPU dedicated
  to the VLM — do not co-locate another GPU service on it. Treat both as hard
  constraints when you are the one choosing the variant.
- **Surface an unsupported-hardware Super request before acting on it.** If Super
  is requested and the detected GPUs are neither H100 nor RTX PRO 6000, or no GPU
  can be dedicated to RT-VLM, stop and tell the user which constraint their system
  fails and what the detected hardware and placement actually are. Then ask
  (`AskUserQuestion`) whether to fall back to the equivalent Nano variant or
  override the constraint anyway. Only proceed with Super after the user overrides
  it knowingly — never assume the request itself is the override, and never
  silently downgrade to Nano either.
- Only the BF16 tag differs in shape between families (`bf16-final` for Nano,
  `modelopt-bf16-final` for Super). Copy tags verbatim rather than deriving them.
- `RTVI_VLM_MODEL_TO_USE=cosmos-reason3` for all six rows, and the served
  endpoint stays `http://rtvi-vlm:8000`; neither changes with the variant.

## Singleton and variant convergence

RT-VLM is a singleton owner: one instance, one checkpoint, and one
variant/placement knob-set per build. When capabilities bring different
integrated Cosmos3 Nano variants, resolve the placement first, then converge on
one variant:

- a dedicated GPU selects the heavier BF16 variant;
- co-residence with another GPU service selects the lighter FP8 variant.

Resolve the variant/placement knobs as one set:
`RTVI_VLM_MODEL_PATH`, `VLM_NAME`, `RTVI_VLLM_GPU_MEMORY_UTILIZATION`,
`RTVI_VLM_MAX_MODEL_LEN`, and `RT_VLM_DEVICE_ID`. Take the checkpoint and model
name from the profile that ships the resolved variant; resolve maximum model
length, device ID, and utilization together for the selected hardware and
placement. Keep `VLM_NAME` aligned with the model id advertised by
`RTVI_VLM_MODEL_PATH` — one row of
[Available integrated model variants](#available-integrated-model-variants) —
and do not combine values from different variants.

Consumer wiring is not part of that set.
`RTVI_VLM_KAFKA_ENABLED`, `RTVI_VLM_MESSAGE_BUS_TOPIC` (generated captions),
`RTVI_VLM_KAFKA_INCIDENT_TOPIC` (verification incidents), and verifier config
mounts follow the consuming capability and operating mode, never the profile that
supplied the variant. Realtime VLM alerting (`2d_vlm`) must set Kafka enablement
to `true` even when the variant profile defaults it to `false`, or no incidents
are published; CV verification (`2d_cv`) keeps it `false` — verified incidents
reach Elasticsearch through the alert bridge, not RT-VLM's Kafka path. For the
integrated path, `RTVI_VLM_MODEL_TO_USE=cosmos-reason3` and
the `http://rtvi-vlm:8000` endpoint (a consumer's `VLM_BASE_URL`) are invariant
across BF16 and FP8; a consumer owns that URL but never inherits it from the
variant profile.
