"""Decide which first-party images the GHCR build workflow must build.

Emits a GitHub Actions matrix (JSON on stdout) with one entry per
``ghcr_build: true`` image from deploy/docker/container-inventory.json whose
source folder changed in the pushed range.

Diff-range rules (the subtle part — get the PUSH event right):

* ``push`` to ``develop``          → diff ``<event.before>..HEAD``. The naive
  ``origin/develop...HEAD`` is ALWAYS empty on this event because the fetched
  branch head IS the pushed commit.
* ``push`` to ``pull-request/N``   → diff ``merge-base(origin/<base>, HEAD)..HEAD``
  so the matrix reflects the whole PR, not just its last push.
* Initial push (``before`` is the zero SHA), force-push that orphaned
  ``before``, or any range git cannot resolve → **build everything**. Building
  too much is safe; silently building nothing is the failure mode this
  replaces.
* A change to the build workflow itself or the build scripts also builds
  everything (the build contract changed, so every image must re-prove it).
